# Trajectory-Simulator
A small JavaScript based browser-application with some integrated speech control. I must have written it around 2015.
The project is literally my first ever script in JavaScript, I did it for fun aand 
### Usage
There are two ways:
1. Just click on the 'Trajectory Simulator.html' and let it load. A downside is, in this case the voice control won't work.
2. For the full version you should try to serve the project folder with e.g. Apache or NodeJs and then "click on the 'Trajectory Simulator.html'" :)
